                Stochastic variation in protein expression generates phenotypic
                heterogeneity in a cell population and has an important role in
                antibiotic persistence, mutation penetrance, tumor growth and
                therapy resistance. Studies investigating molecular origins of
                noise have predominantly focused on the transcription process.
                However, the noise generated in the transcription process is
                further modulated by translation. This influences the expression
                noise at the protein level which eventually determines the
                extent of phenotypic heterogeneity in a cell population. Studies
                across different organisms have revealed a positive association
                between translational efficiency and protein noise. However, the
                molecular basis of this association has remained unknown. In
                this work, through stochastic modeling of translation in single
                mRNA molecules and empirical measurements of protein noise, we
                show that ribosome demand associated with high translational
                efficiency in a gene drives the correlation between
                translational efficiency and protein noise. We also show that
                this correlation is present only in genes with bursty
                transcription. Thus, our work reveals the molecular basis of how
                coding sequence of genes, along with their promoters, can
                regulate noise. These findings have important implications for
                investigating protein noise and phenotypic heterogeneity across
                biological systems.

                Many organisms live in predictable environments with periodic
                variation in growth condition which can allow populations to
                accumulate cryptic genetic variations. Cryptic variations can
                facilitate adaptation to new environments, as observed in
                evolution experiments with a ribozyme and a protein. Whether the
                same holds for cell populations remains unclear. Alternatively,
                living in a near-constant condition can lead to loss of
                nonessential cellular functions, which could be maladaptive in
                new environments. Through laboratory evolution experiments in
                yeast, we show that populations grown in a predictable
                nutrient-rich environment for 1000 generations start to lose
                their ability to respond and adapt to new stressful
                environments. Growth of yeast populations in the nutrient-rich
                environment was associated with modest fitness increase in this
                environment, metabolic remodeling, and increased lipid
                accumulation. In novel stressful environments, however, these
                populations generally had reduced fitness, except in salt-stress
                where lipid accumulation seemed to provide osmotic protection.
                We further found that adaptation to stressors was primarily
                driven by de novo mutations, with very little contribution from
                the mutations accumulated prior to the exposure to stressors.
                Thus, our work suggests that in the absence of occurrence of new
                environments, natural populations might not accumulate cryptic
                variations that could be beneficial for adaptation to these
                environments. In addition, presence of selection in predictable
                condition in natural populations may purge away some of the
                cryptic variations. Taken together, these findings raise
                questions about persistence of cryptic variations in natural
                populations and their importance in evolutionary adaptation.

            Transcriptional noise: Contribution towards cancer progression

                Fluctuations in the number of regulatory molecules and
                differences in timings of molecular events can generate
                variation in gene expression among genetically identical cells
                in the same environmental condition. This variation, termed as
                expression noise, can create differences in metabolic state and
                cellular functions, leading to phenotypic heterogeneity.
                Expression noise and phenotypic heterogeneity have been
                recognized as important contributors to intra-tumor
                heterogeneity, and have been associated with cancer growth,
                progression, and therapy resistance. However, how expression
                noise changes with cancer progression in actual cancer patients
                has remained poorly explored. Such an analysis, through
                identification of genes with increasing expression noise, can
                provide valuable insights into generation of intra-tumor
                heterogeneity, and could have important implications for
                understanding immune-suppression, drug tolerance and therapy
                resistance. In this work, we performed a genome-wide
                identification of changes in gene expression noise with cancer
                progression using single-cell RNA-seq data of lung
                adenocarcinoma patients at different stages of cancer. We
                identified 37 genes in epithelial cells that showed an
                increasing noise trend with cancer progression, many of which
                were also associated with cancer growth, EMT and therapy
                resistance. We found that expression of several of these genes
                was positively associated with expression of mitochondrial
                genes, suggesting an important role of mitochondria in
                generation of heterogeneity. In addition, we uncovered
                substantial differences in sample-specific noise profiles which
                could have implications for personalized prognosis and
                treatment.
